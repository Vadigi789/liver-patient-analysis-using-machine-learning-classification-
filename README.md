Introduction

Liver disease is a significant global health concern, affecting millions worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved outcomes. Traditional methods for liver disease identification often involve invasive procedures and can be time-consuming. Machine learning offers a promising alternative, enabling the development of automated systems capable of accurately predicting liver disease based on various patient characteristics.

This comparative analysis focuses on three popular machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These algorithms have been extensively used in medical applications and demonstrate their effectiveness in handling complex datasets.

Data Preparation

A crucial step in any machine learning project is data preparation. This involves:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant patient data, such as age, gender, bilirubin levels, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and other liver function tests.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.
